# Exercise 2 - 2/10/2016

The aim of this exercise is to enocurage you to build a stream processing pipeline that uses the inferred rate of your stream to alert. 

# Defintion
This exercise is split into three parts:
 1. Build a system to track the rate of a stream of data. You can use the stream of data you found in exercise 1 or a new stream. (40%)
 2. Build an alerting system to let you know when the rate does something interesting to you. This could be that the rate has increased above a threshold, or decreased, or demonstrates "unlikely" behaviour. (40%)
 3. Connect the alerting system to a human-readable system. This could be, for example, a webpage, a slack channel, or a twitter bot. (20%)

# Grading

Each part will be graded by reading, and potentially running, the code you submit. We will be looking for a clear description of how the parts of your code work from the comments. For the third part of the exercise, we will be looking for alerts that indicate some sort of interesting aspect of the stream, and comments that explain why you find the alerts potentially interesting.
